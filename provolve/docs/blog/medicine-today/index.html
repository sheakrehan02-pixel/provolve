<p>Artificial intelligence is being integrated into diagnostic imaging, allowing earlier detection of conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders. Machine learning models assist physicians in identifying patterns that would otherwise go unnoticed.</p>
<p>At the same time, medicine is shifting toward prevention. Wearable devices, continuous glucose monitors, and remote patient monitoring systems are empowering individuals to take control of their health before disease progresses.</p>
<p>Despite these advances, challenges remain. Healthcare access, cost disparities, and ethical concerns surrounding data usage continue to shape the future of medicine.</p> </div> </article>  </main> <footer class="border-t mt-16 py-8"> <div class="container mx-auto px-4 text-center text-gray-600"> <p>&copy; 2025 Provolve.
